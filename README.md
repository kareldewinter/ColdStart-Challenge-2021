# ColdStart Challenge 2021

This will be my contribution to the [**ColdStart coding challenge 2021**](https://github.com/ColdStart-Challenge)

This coding challenge is a story of two penguins who are taking their first steps as startup founders. They are planning to begin an ice cream parlor and home delivery service, called ColdStart üç®.

They have no clue of how to build and host a website, process customer orders and track and trace the home deliveries. They're calling on you for help!

We will be using Microsoft Azure cloud services to build all of the IT infrastructure needed for running their entire business.

I'm sure this will be fun, and I'm also sure this will be a hard coding challenge for me! So let's see how far I can get.
